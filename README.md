## Requirements

Implement a STACK for different types with the following operations:

1. `Push`: Stores an object on top of the stack.
2. `Pop`: Removes the object on top of the stack and returns it.
3. `Print`: Prints out all stack objects.
4. `Peak`: return the object on top of the stack if exists without removing it.
5. `Clear`: Removes all objects from the stack.
